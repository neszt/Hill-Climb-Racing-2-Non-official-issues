# Hill Climb Racing 2 - Non official issues

This repo for Hill Climb Racing 2 is an unofficial issue database.

Why did I create it?
 - To collect the bugs and development ideas I noticed myself
 - To encourage others to do the same
 - To discuss these together and find workarounds
 - Because I haven't found one yet

What is this for?
 - Share any bugs or development ideas
 - Discuss, help each other
 - Share a screenshot or video link that best demonstrates the bug

What is this not for?
 - Expect any fix from Fingersoft (this is completely non-official)
 - Recover a lost account
 - Discuss any vehicle / track setup or optimal strategy (there are several discord channels for this)
 - Share your own time records and parts you have acquired (there are several discord channels for this)
 - To criticize anyone, any player, developer
